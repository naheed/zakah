## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in ZakatFlow, please report it to us privately so we can address it before it can be exploited.

### How to Report

Please email your findings directly to the lead maintainer:
📩 **[naheed@vora.dev](mailto:naheed@vora.dev)**

Alternatively, if you prefer to communicate via GitHub, please send a direct message to [@naheed](https://github.com/naheed) or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature if enabled on the repository.

- A detailed description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
- Details about your environment (e.g., browser, OS, environment variables).
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment:** We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
2. **Investigation:** We will investigate the issue and confirm whether the vulnerability is valid. We may ask for further information or clarification during this phase.
3. **Resolution:** If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a patch and coordinate a release.
