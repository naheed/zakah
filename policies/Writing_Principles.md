# ZakatFlow Writing Principles & Voice Guidelines

**Role:** Senior Product Counsel & Technical Writer  
**Audience:** High Net Worth (HNW) Individuals seeking spiritual compliance in financial matters.  
**Core Voice:** Empathetic, Professional, Transparent, Authoritative yet Humble.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Empathy First, Legalese Second
Legal documents should protect the company but respects the user. Avoid aggressive, all-caps shouting (e.g., "YOU MUST") where possible. Use plain, respectful language.
*   **Bad:** "YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR DATA."
*   **Good:** "We design our systems to keep you in control, which means you ultimately hold the responsibility for verifying your financial inputs."

### 1.2 No "Hallucinations" or False Promises
Every claim must be backed by code or policy.
*   **Never say:** "We never see your data" if a server log might capture it.
*   **Say:** "We design our systems to minimize data exposure, encrypting your inputs before they reach our database."

### 1.3 Professional Warmth
The tone should feel like a trusted private banker or a wise scholar—calm, competent, and discreet.
*   **Avoid:** Tech jargon ("JSON payload", "OAuth token") unless explaining technical security.
*   **Avoid:** Overly casual slang ("Cool", "Awesome").
*   **Use:** "Secure," "Private," "Verified," "Amana (Trust)."

## 2. Specific Guidelines

### 2.1 Plaid & Integration Language
When discussing third-party tools (Plaid, Google Gemini), be transparent about the tradeoff between convenience and privacy.
*   **Principle:** Do not hide the third party. Acknowledge them as a trusted partner but clarify boundaries.
*   **Lost Detail Check:** Ensure we explicitly state *what* is shared (balance, transaction history) and *what is not* (credentials, rights to move money).

### 2.2 Religious Humility (Adab)
When discussing methodology, never claim to be the *sole* truth. Acknowledge the diversity of Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh).
*   ** phrasing:** "Based on the opinion of..." rather than "The correct ruling is..."

### 2.3 Liability Limitations
Frame liability limits as a necessity for providing a free/low-cost software tool, not as an abdication of care.
*   **Approach:** "To continue providing this service sustainably, we must limit our liability..."

## 3. Maintenance
This document shall be reviewed alongside any major feature launch (e.g., new AI features, Payments) to ensure our voice remains consistent.
