# ZakatFlow V2 Migration Backlog

**Architecture Migration:** From Form-Centric Calculator → Asset-Centric Wealth OS

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Data Layer) ✅ COMPLETE

> **Goal:** Create new tables and Types without breaking the existing UI.

- [x] **Schema Migration** - Created `portfolios`, `asset_accounts`, `asset_snapshots`, `asset_line_items` tables

- [x] **Debug Component** - Created `ZakatAdapterTest.tsx` for verifying adapter logic

---

> **Goal:** High-fidelity line-item extraction from financial documents.

- [x] **Prompt Engineering** - Updated Gemini system prompt for granular line-item extraction
- [x] **Edge Function Update** - `parse-financial-document` returns `lineItems[]` with `inferredCategory` and `confidence`
- [x] **Category Mapping** - Built `mapLineItemToLegacyField()` for backward compatibility

### 4.1 Plaid Integration

## Phase 5: Charity Partner Program ⬜ PLANNED

> **Goal:** Enable charities to integrate ZakatFlow, maintain their lead gen while we handle calculation.

### Strategy Considerations
| Option | Charity Gets | We Get | Lead Gen |
|--------|--------------|--------|----------|
| **Embed Widget** | Calculator on their site | Traffic attribution | Charity keeps 100% |
| **White-Label** | Branded calculator | Subscription fee | Charity keeps 100% |
| **Referral Link** | Branded landing page | Free users | Shared (we capture email) |
| **API Integration** | Raw calculation engine | API fees | Charity keeps 100% |

### Recommended: Embed Widget + Attribution
- Low friction for charity adoption
- Co-branded experience ("Powered by ZakatFlow")
- We get SEO backlinks + brand awareness
- Charity retains full control of donor relationship

### 5.1 Charity Portal (`/charities`)
- [ ] Landing page explaining partnership options
- [ ] Self-serve embed code generator
- [ ] Attribution dashboard (how many calcs from their widget)
- [ ] Contact form for white-label inquiries

### 5.2 Embeddable Widget
- [ ] Standalone JS widget (`<script>` embed)
- [ ] Configurable branding (charity logo, colors)
- [ ] Callback when calculation complete (for charity CRM)
- [ ] Privacy-preserving: no PII shared, only calc totals

---

## Phase 6: Reports & History ⬜ PLANNED

> **Goal:** Historical record of Zakat calculations.

- [ ] `/reports` view listing "Frozen" Zakat Reports
- [ ] Each report stores frozen params (gold price, nisab, rules version)
- [ ] PDF download from frozen data (idempotent)
- [ ] Year-over-year comparison charts

---

## Phase 7: Migration & Smart Features ⬜ FUTURE

> **Goal:** Transition existing users and enable premium features.

- [ ] Consent flow: "Enable Smart Features?" vs "Stay Local (Vault Mode)"
- [ ] Data migration script for legacy users
- [ ] Multi-device sync for Smart Mode
- [ ] Automated Hawl date detection
