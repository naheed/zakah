> **Based on Classical Jurisprudence and Modern Scholarship**

This guide outlines best practices for distributing your Zakat according to Islamic jurisprudence.

## 1. The Eight Categories of Recipients (Asnaf)

The Quran (9:60) specifies eight categories of eligible Zakat recipients:

1. **Al-Fuqara'** (The Poor) — Those whose needs exceed their means
2. **Al-Masakin** (The Needy) — Those in hardship but not absolute poverty
3. **Al-'Amilin** (Zakat Administrators) — Collectors and distributors
4. **Al-Mu'allafah Qulubuhum** (Hearts to be Reconciled) — New Muslims or potential converts
5. **Ar-Riqab** (Freeing of Bondage) — Historically for freeing slaves; today some scholars apply to human trafficking victims
6. **Al-Gharimin** (The Debtors) — Those in debt who cannot repay
7. **Fi Sabil Allah** (In the Cause of God) — See detailed discussion below
8. **Ibn as-Sabil** (The Wayfarer) — Travelers in need

## 2. Fi Sabil Allah (In the Cause of God) — Scholarly Debate

### Classical Position (Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mughni)

> **Strict Interpretation**: Restricts to **military defense and Jihad** only.

Ibn Qudamah explicitly argues against using Zakat for Hajj (pilgrimage), stating that "In the Cause of God" when unqualified refers to defense of the Muslim community.

### Modern Positions

Some contemporary scholars extend this category to include:
- **Da'wah** (Islamic propagation and education)
- **Islamic schools and institutions**
- **Ideological and intellectual defense of Islam**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you follow a **traditional opinion**, direct your "Fi Sabil Allah" portion to refugee relief, humanitarian defense, or verified Islamic relief organizations.

## 3. Can I Forgive a Debt as Zakat?

### Majority View (Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki)

> **No.** Zakat requires *Tamlik* (transfer of ownership) of an asset to the recipient.

Forgiving a debt does not transfer anything — it merely extinguishes a liability. The poor person does not "receive" wealth.

### Minority View (Shafi'i, Hasan al-Basri)

> **Yes, in certain cases.**

Some Shafi'i opinions allow counting forgiven debt as Zakat, arguing that relieving a debtor (Al-Gharimin) is a form of financial support explicitly mentioned in the Quran.

### ZakatFlow Recommendation

If you wish to forgive a debt:
1. Calculate the debt amount
2. Pay that amount as Zakat to a **separate eligible recipient**
3. Then forgive the original debt as Sadaqah (voluntary charity)

This satisfies both the requirement of *Tamlik* and your charitable intent.

## 4. Practical Tips

### Local vs. Global
- Most scholars permit sending Zakat to distant locations if greater need exists there
- Some Hanafi opinions prefer local distribution unless local needs are met

### Verification
- Verify the eligibility of recipients when possible
- Use reputable Zakat organizations with scholarly oversight (e.g., Islamic Relief, Zakat Foundation)

### Timing
- Zakat can be paid early if need is urgent
- Calculate annually on your Zakat anniversary (Hawl)

### Documentation
- Keep records of Zakat payments
- Some scholars recommend obtaining receipts for accountability
