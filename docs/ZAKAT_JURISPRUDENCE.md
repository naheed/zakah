## 1. Introduction: The Epistemological and Historical Framework

The study of Zakat (obligatory almsgiving) within Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) represents a sophisticated intersection of theology, law, sociology, and economics. Unlike voluntary charity (Sadaqah), Zakat is a codified fiscal obligation characterized by:

- **Nisab**: Precise thresholds
- **Hawl**: Defined cycles (lunar year)
- **Asnaf**: Strictly delineated categories of beneficiaries

This report provides an exhaustive analysis anchored in the primary texts of the four canonical Sunni schools:

| School | Primary Text | Author | Era |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **Hanafi** | Al-Hidayah | Al-Marghinani | d. 1197 CE |
| **Maliki** | Mukhtasar Khalil | Khalil ibn Ishaq | d. 1374 CE |
| **Shafi'i** | Al-Majmu' | Al-Nawawi | d. 1277 CE |
| **Hanbali** | Al-Mughni | Ibn Qudamah | d. 1223 CE |

## 2. The Hanafi School: Rationalism and Commercial Pragmatism

### 2.1 Historical Context
Originating in Kufa, Iraq—a bustling cosmopolitan trade center—the Hanafi school is characterized by *Ahl al-Ra'y* (proponents of reasoned opinion) and pragmatic commercial law.

### 2.2 Debt Deduction (Core Doctrine)

> **Hanafi Position**: *Dayn yamna' wujub al-Zakat* — Debt prevents the obligation of Zakat.

**Reasoning (Al-Hidayah)**:
- Zakat is a levy on "surplus" wealth (*Fadl*)
- A debtor's ownership is "defective" (*Mulk Naqis*) because creditor rights are attached
- Only debts demanded by humans prevent Zakat (not debts to God like expiations)
- This transforms Zakat from a **gross asset tax** into a **net worth tax**

**Modern Application: The 12-Month Rule**
- Classical application would exempt millionaires with large mortgages
- **AAOIFI and Mufti Taqi Usmani** introduced restriction: only deduct payments due within the coming **lunar year**
- Harmonizes classical principle with modern amortized debt

### 2.3 Hawl Continuity

> **Hanafi Position**: Nisab required at **Start** and **End** only. Mid-year fluctuations are ignored (unless wealth reaches absolute zero).

**Rationale**: Simplified accounting for pre-modern merchants lacking sophisticated ledgers.

### 2.4 Jewelry

> **Hanafi Position**: Gold/silver jewelry is **zakatable** regardless of use (adornment or storage).

**Evidence**: Hadith of the woman with gold bracelets warned of "bracelets of fire."

**Sociological Factor**: In Iraqi commercial centers, gold was a primary store of value. Taxing substance (gold/silver) rather than form prevents hoarding loopholes.

## 3. The Maliki School: The Practice of Medina and Economic Velocity

### 3.1 The Mudir vs. Muhtakir Distinction

This is **unique to the Maliki school** and addresses the concept of "velocity of money."

| Type | Definition | Ruling | Modern Parallel |
|------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Mudir** (Active Trader) | Buys and sells continuously at market prices; high inventory turnover | Annual valuation of entire inventory, cash, receivables | Day trader, retailer |
| **Muhtakir** (Speculator) | Holds goods waiting for price appreciation; may hold for years | Zakat **only upon sale**, for **one year only** | Real estate investor, startup founder with illiquid equity |

**Economic Logic**:
- Muhtakir may have no cash to pay annual Zakat on paper gains
- Taxing only upon realization prevents forced distress sales
- Mirrors modern distinction between income tax and capital gains tax

### 3.2 Debt Deduction

> **Maliki Position**: Debt deductible from **monetary assets** (gold, silver, trade goods) but NOT from agricultural produce or livestock.

**Crucial Condition**: Debt can only be deducted if the debtor has **no other fixed assets** (house, furniture) to cover it. This prevents the wealthy from using debt as a tax shield.

### 3.3 Jewelry

> **Maliki Position**: Permissible jewelry for personal adornment is **exempt**.

---

## 4. The Shafi'i School: Systematic Theology and Absolute Liability

### 4.1 Debt Deduction (Most Rigorous Position)

> **Shafi'i Position**: **Debt does NOT prevent Zakat liability.**

**Ruling**: A person with $10,000 cash and $20,000 debt is still liable for Zakat on the $10,000.

**Juristic Reasoning (Al-Nawawi)**:
1. **Attachment to Asset**: Zakat is a right of the poor attached to the specific material asset (*Ayn*), not a liability on the person's conscience (*Dhimmah*)
2. **Separation of Liabilities**: Debt to humans and Zakat to God are separate; one does not cancel the other
3. **Social Priority**: Ensures consistent flow of funds to the poor

### 4.2 Hawl Continuity

> **Shafi'i Position**: **Strict continuity required.** If wealth dips below Nisab at any moment during the year, the Hawl is broken and restarts.

### 4.3 Jewelry

> **Shafi'i Position**: Permissible jewelry (*Huli Mubah*) for personal use is **exempt**.

**Conditions**: Must be for adornment, not extravagant (*Israf*), and not hoarded as bullion.

## 5. The Hanbali School: Traditionalism and Comparative Synthesis

### 5.1 Debt Deduction

> **Hanbali Position**: Aligns with Hanafi — Debt prevents Zakat.

**Evidence (Ibn Qudamah)**: Cites Uthman ibn Affan: "This is the month of your Zakat. Whoever has a debt should pay it, so that you give Zakat on your [remaining] wealth."

### 5.2 Fi Sabil Allah (In the Cause of God)

Ibn Qudamah restricts this **strictly to Jihad** (defense/military) and support of warriors without state stipend. Explicitly argues against using Zakat for Hajj.

**Modern Debate**: Some scholars extend to Da'wah (propagation); traditionalists maintain the classical restriction.

### 5.3 Trade Goods and Intention

Heavy emphasis on **Niyyah (Intention)**. An asset is only zakatable as trade goods if there is specific, continuous intent to sell for profit. Changing intent to personal use immediately cuts the Hawl.

## 6. Comparative Analysis

### 6.1 Ontology of Wealth

| Model | Schools | Philosophy | Modern Parallel |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Net Worth** | Hanafi, Hanbali | Zakat as tax on solvency; protective of middle class | Net worth tax |
| **Gross Assets** | Shafi'i | Zakat as ritual purification of matter; protects rights of poor | Gross asset tax |
| **Velocity** | Maliki | Fast-moving wealth taxed annually; slow-moving taxed at exit | Income tax vs. capital gains |

### 6.2 Comparative Matrix

| Feature | Hanafi | Maliki | Shafi'i | Hanbali |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Debt Deduction** | Yes (General) | Partial (if no other assets) | No | Yes (General) |
| **Trade Goods Valuation** | Year-end (Start & End) | Mudir: Annual / Muhtakir: Upon sale | Year-end | Year-end |
| **Hawl Continuity** | Start & End only | Continuous | Continuous | Continuous |
| **Jewelry** | **Zakatable** | Exempt | Exempt | Exempt |
| **Zakat on Loans (Creditor)** | Pay when received for all years | One year only upon receipt | Pay annually | Pay annually |

### 6.3 The "Debt Shield" Problem

**Classical Context**: Debt was typically a sign of distress.
**Modern Context**: Debt is a leverage tool used by the wealthy (mortgages, business loans).

**The Loophole**: Strict classical Hanafi/Hanbali allows a millionaire to deduct $5M mortgage from $1M savings = no Zakat.

**Modern Corrections**:
- AAOIFI: Hybrid model restricting debt deduction
- Modern Hanafi: 12-month rule
- Maliki condition: Debt covered by fixed assets first

## 7. Contemporary Applications

### 7.1 Modern Mortgages

**The Problem**: Deducting a 30-year liability in one Zakat year destroys the Zakat base.

**The Fatwa (Mufti Taqi Usmani)**: Distinguish "immediate demands" from "deferred liabilities." Only deduct principal + interest payments due within the upcoming **lunar year**.

### 7.2 AAOIFI Shari'ah Standard No. 35

- Accepts corporate entity as having distinct financial personality liable for Zakat
- Focus on **Net Current Assets**
- Deducts current liabilities (due within financial period)
- Restricts deduction of long-term equity/financing

### 7.3 Zakat on Shares and Investments

| Investor Type | Treatment | Parallel |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Day Trader** | Mudir — pay Zakat on market value annually | Trade goods |
| **Long-term Investor** | Pay on zakatable assets of company (cash, inventory) proportional to shares, or dividends only | Passive ownership |

### 7.4 Forgiving Debt as Zakat

| Position | Ruling | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Majority** (Hanafi/Hanbali/Maliki) | **No** | Zakat requires transfer of ownership (*Tamlik*); forgiving debt destroys liability, doesn't transfer asset |
| **Minority** (Shafi'i/Hasan al-Basri) | **Yes** | Relieving debtor is financial support (Al-Gharimin category) |

## 8. Conclusion

The analysis reveals Zakat jurisprudence is not monolithic but a vibrant conversation spanning centuries:

- **Hanafi (Al-Hidayah)**: Pragmatic, solvency-based approach from Silk Road merchants
- **Maliki (Mukhtasar Khalil)**: Sophisticated economic theory of liquidity and velocity
- **Shafi'i (Al-Majmu')**: Rigorous theological attachment protecting rights of the poor
- **Hanbali (Al-Mughni)**: Comparative synthesis balancing tradition with rational categorization

These texts provide the **source code** for solving 21st-century economic dilemmas. The evolution from "debts to humans" in 12th-century Kufa to "12 months of mortgage payments" in 21st-century London demonstrates the dynamic resilience of Islamic jurisprudence.
