## 1. Introduction: The Epistemological and Historical Framework

The study of Zakat (obligatory almsgiving) within Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh) represents a sophisticated intersection of theology, law, sociology, and economics. Unlike voluntary charity (Sadaqah), Zakat is a codified fiscal obligation characterized by:

- **Nisab**: Precise thresholds
- **Hawl**: Defined cycles (lunar year)
- **Asnaf**: Strictly delineated categories of beneficiaries

This report provides an exhaustive analysis anchored in the primary texts of the four canonical Sunni schools:

| School | Primary Text | Author | Era |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|
| **Hanafi** | Al-Hidayah | Al-Marghinani | d. 1197 CE |
| **Maliki** | Mukhtasar Khalil | Khalil ibn Ishaq | d. 1374 CE |
| **Shafi'i** | Al-Majmu' | Al-Nawawi | d. 1277 CE |
| **Hanbali** | Al-Mughni | Ibn Qudamah | d. 1223 CE |

---

## 2. The Hanafi School: Rationalism and Commercial Pragmatism

### 2.1 Historical Context
Originating in Kufa, Iraq—a bustling cosmopolitan trade center—the Hanafi school is characterized by *Ahl al-Ra'y* (proponents of reasoned opinion) and pragmatic commercial law.

### 2.2 Debt Deduction (Core Doctrine)

> **Hanafi Position**: *Dayn yamna' wujub al-Zakat* — Debt prevents the obligation of Zakat.

**Reasoning (Al-Hidayah)**:
- Zakat is a levy on "surplus" wealth (*Fadl*)
- A debtor's ownership is "defective" (*Mulk Naqis*) because creditor rights are attached
- Only debts demanded by humans prevent Zakat (not debts to God like expiations)
- This transforms Zakat from a **gross asset tax** into a **net worth tax**

**Modern Application: The 12-Month Rule**
- Classical application would exempt millionaires with large mortgages
- **AAOIFI and Mufti Taqi Usmani** introduced restriction: only deduct payments due within the coming **lunar year**
- Harmonizes classical principle with modern amortized debt

### 2.3 Hawl Continuity

> **Hanafi Position**: Nisab at **Start & End only** (dips ignored)

**Rationale**: Simplified accounting for pre-modern merchants lacking sophisticated ledgers.

> [!NOTE]
> **Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali** require **continuous** Nisab possession. Any dip below threshold during the year breaks the Hawl.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ZakatFlow Implementation**: Full Hawl tracking requires connected accounts via Plaid for complete asset visibility. Without this, users should manually verify their Nisab status using their own records.

### 2.4 Jewelry

> **Hanafi Position**: Gold/silver jewelry is **zakatable** regardless of use (adornment or storage).

**Evidence**: Hadith of the woman with gold bracelets warned of "bracelets of fire."

**Sociological Factor**: In Iraqi commercial centers, gold was a primary store of value. Taxing substance (gold/silver) rather than form prevents hoarding loopholes.

---

## 3. The Maliki School: The Practice of Medina and Economic Velocity

### 3.1 The Mudir vs. Muhtakir Distinction

This is **unique to the Maliki school** and addresses the concept of "velocity of money."

| Type | Definition | Ruling | Modern Parallel |
|------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Mudir** (Active Trader) | Buys and sells continuously at market prices; high inventory turnover | Annual valuation of entire inventory, cash, receivables | Day trader, retailer |
| **Muhtakir** (Speculator) | Holds goods waiting for price appreciation; may hold for years | Zakat **only upon sale**, for **one year only** | Real estate investor, startup founder with illiquid equity |

**Economic Logic**:
- Muhtakir may have no cash to pay annual Zakat on paper gains
- Taxing only upon realization prevents forced distress sales
- Mirrors modern distinction between income tax and capital gains tax

### 3.2 Debt Deduction

> **Maliki Position**: Debt deductible from **monetary assets** (gold, silver, trade goods) but NOT from agricultural produce or livestock.

**Crucial Condition**: Debt can only be deducted if the debtor has **no other fixed assets** (house, furniture) to cover it. This prevents the wealthy from using debt as a tax shield.

### 3.3 Jewelry

> **Maliki Position**: Permissible jewelry for personal adornment is **exempt**.

---

## 4. The Shafi'i School: Systematic Theology and Absolute Liability

### 4.1 Debt Deduction (Most Rigorous Position)

> **Shafi'i Position**: **Debt does NOT prevent Zakat liability.**

**Ruling**: A person with $10,000 cash and $20,000 debt is still liable for Zakat on the $10,000.

**Juristic Reasoning (Al-Nawawi)**:
1. **Attachment to Asset**: Zakat is a right of the poor attached to the specific material asset (*Ayn*), not a liability on the person's conscience (*Dhimmah*)
2. **Separation of Liabilities**: Debt to humans and Zakat to God are separate; one does not cancel the other
3. **Social Priority**: Ensures consistent flow of funds to the poor

### 4.2 Hawl Continuity

> **Shafi'i Position**: **Strict continuity required.** If wealth dips below Nisab at any moment during the year, the Hawl is broken and restarts.

### 4.3 Jewelry

> **Shafi'i Position**: Permissible jewelry (*Huli Mubah*) for personal use is **exempt**.

**Conditions**: Must be for adornment, not extravagant (*Israf*), and not hoarded as bullion.

---

## 5. The Hanbali School: Traditionalism and Comparative Synthesis

### 5.1 Debt Deduction

> **Hanbali Position**: Aligns with Hanafi — Debt prevents Zakat.

**Evidence (Ibn Qudamah)**: Cites Uthman ibn Affan: "This is the month of your Zakat. Whoever has a debt should pay it, so that you give Zakat on your [remaining] wealth."

### 5.2 Fi Sabil Allah (In the Cause of God)

Ibn Qudamah restricts this **strictly to Jihad** (defense/military) and support of warriors without state stipend. Explicitly argues against using Zakat for Hajj.

**Modern Debate**: Some scholars extend to Da'wah (propagation); traditionalists maintain the classical restriction.

### 5.3 Trade Goods and Intention

Heavy emphasis on **Niyyah (Intention)**. An asset is only zakatable as trade goods if there is specific, continuous intent to sell for profit. Changing intent to personal use immediately cuts the Hawl.

---

## 6. Comparative Analysis

### 6.1 Ontology of Wealth

| Model | Schools | Philosophy | Modern Parallel |
|-------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Net Worth** | Hanafi, Hanbali | Zakat as tax on solvency; protective of middle class | Net worth tax |
| **Gross Assets** | Shafi'i | Zakat as ritual purification of matter; protects rights of poor | Gross asset tax |
| **Velocity** | Maliki | Fast-moving wealth taxed annually; slow-moving taxed at exit | Income tax vs. capital gains |

### 6.2 Comparative Matrix

| Feature | Hanafi | Maliki | Shafi'i | Hanbali |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| **Debt Deduction** | Yes (General) | Partial (if no other assets) | No | Yes (General) |
| **Trade Goods Valuation** | Year-end (Start & End) | Mudir: Annual / Muhtakir: Upon sale | Year-end | Year-end |
| **Hawl Continuity** | Start & End only | Continuous | Continuous | Continuous |
| **Jewelry** | **Zakatable** | Exempt | Exempt | Exempt |
| **Zakat on Loans (Creditor)** | Pay when received for all years | One year only upon receipt | Pay annually | Pay annually |

### 6.3 The "Debt Shield" Problem

**Classical Context**: Debt was typically a sign of distress.
**Modern Context**: Debt is a leverage tool used by the wealthy (mortgages, business loans).

**The Loophole**: Strict classical Hanafi/Hanbali allows a millionaire to deduct $5M mortgage from $1M savings = no Zakat.

**Modern Corrections**:
- AAOIFI: Hybrid model restricting debt deduction
- Modern Hanafi: 12-month rule
- Maliki condition: Debt covered by fixed assets first

---

## 7. Contemporary Applications

### 7.1 Modern Mortgages

**The Problem**: Deducting a 30-year liability in one Zakat year destroys the Zakat base.

**The Fatwa (Mufti Taqi Usmani)**: Distinguish "immediate demands" from "deferred liabilities." Only deduct principal + interest payments due within the upcoming **lunar year**.

### 7.2 AAOIFI Shari'ah Standard No. 35

- Accepts corporate entity as having distinct financial personality liable for Zakat
- Focus on **Net Current Assets**
- Deducts current liabilities (due within financial period)
- Restricts deduction of long-term equity/financing

### 7.3 Zakat on Shares and Investments

| Investor Type | Treatment | Parallel |
|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Day Trader** | Mudir — pay Zakat on market value annually | Trade goods |
| **Long-term Investor** | Pay on zakatable assets of company (cash, inventory) proportional to shares, or dividends only | Passive ownership |

### 7.4 Forgiving Debt as Zakat

| Position | Ruling | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Majority** (Hanafi/Hanbali/Maliki) | **No** | Zakat requires transfer of ownership (*Tamlik*); forgiving debt destroys liability, doesn't transfer asset |
| **Minority** (Shafi'i/Hasan al-Basri) | **Yes** | Relieving debtor is financial support (Al-Gharimin category) |

---

## 7.5 Modern Retirement Instruments (401k, IRA, 403b, Pension)

### The Scholarly Debate

Retirement accounts present a novel challenge: they represent wealth that is technically owned but practically inaccessible without significant legal and financial barriers. ZakatFlow supports five distinct approaches via the ZMCS `retirement.zakatability` field.

### 7.5.1 Sheikh Joe Bradford — Conditional Age Exemption

> **Position**: Traditional 401(k)/IRA assets are **exempt** from Zakat for account holders under age 59½. Once the age threshold is reached, a **30% proxy rate** applies on market value.

**ZMCS Config**: `zakatability: 'conditional_age'`, `exemption_age: 59.5`, `post_threshold_method: 'proxy_rate'`, `post_threshold_rate: 0.30`

**Scholarly Basis (Sheikh Joe Bradford, "Simple Zakat Guide")**:

The argument rests on two classical principles:

1. **Lack of Milk Tām (Complete Ownership)**
   - The 10% early withdrawal penalty + income taxes (often 30-40% total) means the owner lacks full disposal rights
   - A substantial portion is "owned" by the government

2. **Māl Ḍimār (Inaccessible Wealth)**
   - Classical jurists exempted wealth in the possession of an uncertain debtor
   - The IRS functions as this "uncertain debtor" — you cannot freely access what is legally yours

**Roth IRA Treatment**: Contributions at 30% proxy rate (`roth_contributions_rate: 0.30`); earnings follow traditional retirement rules.

### 7.5.2 AMJA — Net Accessible Value

> **Position**: Zakat is due annually on the **net accessible value** (vested balance minus taxes and penalties).

**ZMCS Config**: `zakatability: 'net_accessible'`, `penalty_rate: 0.10`

**Scholarly Basis (AMJA Fatwa #77832)**:

1. **Ownership is Established**: The assets are legally owned once vested
2. **Penalty is Merely a Cost**: The 10% penalty is a cost of liquidation, not a Shariah barrier to ownership
3. **The Asset has Nama'**: The funds grow and are productive — a key condition for Zakat

**Formula**:
```
Net Accessible Value = Vested Balance × (1 - Tax Rate - Penalty Rate)
Zakat Due = Net Accessible Value × 2.5%
```

### 7.5.3 Imam Tahir Anwar — Full Balance (Strong Ownership / Hanafi)

> **Position**: The **full vested balance** is zakatable regardless of age or penalties, based on the Hanafi principle of strong ownership (Milk Tām).

**ZMCS Config**: `zakatability: 'full'`

**Scholarly Basis (Hanafi / Zaytuna College)**:

1. **Ownership is Complete**: The account holder is the legal owner of the full vested balance
2. **Penalties are Irrelevant**: Government-imposed penalties do not negate the Shariah reality of ownership
3. **Consistent Treatment**: Aligns with the Hanafi approach that all owned wealth (including jewelry, all investments) is zakatable

**Formula**:
```
Zakat Due = Full Vested Balance × 2.5%
```

### 7.5.4 Dr. Al-Qaradawi — Net Accessible Value

> **Position**: Zakat is due on the **net accessible value** of retirement accounts. Funds that are legally withdrawable (even with penalties) are zakatable. Defined benefit pensions not yet paid out are exempt until distribution.

**ZMCS Config**: `zakatability: 'net_accessible'`

**Scholarly Basis (Fiqh al-Zakah; fiqh.islamonline.net)**:

1. **Accessible Funds Are Zakatable**: "Zakat applies to wealth one owns with freedom to use"
2. **Pension Funds Not Yet Possessed**: Exempt until distribution — similar to a debt owed to you
3. **Employer's Forced Contribution**: Treated as a bonus gift, not zakatable until accessible

Al-Qaradawi explicitly rejects Bradford's total exemption for accessible defined-contribution plans (401k, IRA) where the owner CAN withdraw with penalties.

### 7.5.5 Classical Madhabs — Net Accessible Value

> The four classical madhabs generally follow the **net accessible value** approach, recognizing ownership but accounting for the practical costs of accessing retirement funds.

**ZMCS Config**: `zakatability: 'net_accessible'`

### ZakatFlow Implementation Summary

| Methodology | ZMCS `zakatability` | Under 59½ | Over 59½ | Roth Contributions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bradford (Balanced)** | `conditional_age` | Exempt | 30% proxy on market value | 30% proxy |
| **AMJA** | `net_accessible` | Net accessible (balance − taxes − 10% penalty) | Net accessible | 100% (accessible) |
| **Al-Qaradawi** | `net_accessible` | Net accessible | Net accessible | 100% (accessible) |
| **Imam Tahir Anwar** | `full` | 100% of vested balance | 100% of vested balance | 100% |
| **Classical Madhabs** | `net_accessible` | Net accessible | Net accessible | 100% (accessible) |

### Account Type Nuances

| Account | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Roth IRA/401k Contributions** | Always accessible without penalty. Bradford: 30% proxy. Others: 100% |
| **Roth Earnings** | Subject to penalty if under 59½. Follows the methodology's retirement rules |
| **HSA** | Accessible for medical expenses at any age → Always zakatable |
| **457(b) Governmental** | No 10% penalty → May be more accessible |
| **Defined Benefit Pension** | Apply vested amount; inaccessible until retirement triggers exemption |

## 7.6 Cryptocurrency and Digital Assets

### Classical Analogies

> **Majority Contemporary Position**: Cryptocurrency is analogous to either **currency (thaman)** or **trade goods (ʿurūḍ al-tijārah)**, depending on usage.

### Payment Tokens (BTC, ETH, Stablecoins)

**Ruling**: Treated as currency (thaman). Fully Zakatable at market value on your Zakat date.

**Evidence**: These tokens function as mediums of exchange and stores of value—the two defining characteristics of classical monetary instruments.

### Trade Tokens (Altcoins, NFTs for Flipping)

**Ruling**: Treated as trade goods (ʿurūḍ al-tijārah). Full market value is Zakatable.

**Classical Parallel**: Similar to merchandise held for sale. The Mudir (active trader) annual valuation model applies.

### Staking and Network Validation

**Scholarly Position**: Staking is generally permissible as it represents compensation for a service (network validation), not riba (interest).

| Element | Ruling |
|---------|--------|
| **Principal (Staked Amount)** | Zakatable—you retain ownership |
| **Vested/Claimed Rewards** | Zakatable once claimable |
| **Locked/Unvested Rewards** | Exempt (māl ḍimār until vested) |
| **Unbonding Period** | Still yours—Zakatable |

### DeFi and Liquidity Pools

**Ruling**: Zakatable on the **current redeemable value** of your position.

**Caution**: Many DeFi protocols involve riba (interest-bearing lending). Scholars differ on the permissibility of participation. If impermissible, the interest portion must be purified through charitable donation.

**Impermanent Loss**: Calculate Zakat on what you can actually withdraw today, not original deposit value.

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

| Intent | Ruling |
|--------|--------|
| **Trade (Flipping)** | Zakatable at market value |
| **Personal Collection** | Exempt (qunya) |
| **Utility (Access Passes)** | Generally exempt if used for access, not speculation |

---

## 7.7 The AAOIFI 30% Proxy for Passive Investments

### The Problem

Long-term stock investors (Muhtakir) should technically pay Zakat only on a company's underlying zakatable assets (cash, receivables, inventory)—not the full market cap, which includes goodwill, fixed assets, and intangibles.

Calculating this precisely for hundreds of companies is impractical.

### The AAOIFI Solution (Shariah Standard No. 35)

> **Proxy**: Approximately **25-30%** of a Shariah-compliant company's market value represents zakatable assets.

**Research Basis**: AAOIFI's analysis of Shariah-compliant equities found that the ratio of Net Current Assets (cash + inventory + receivables - current liabilities) to market cap averages 25-30%.

### Implementation

| Proxy | Source | Effective Rate |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **30%** | AAOIFI, Islamic Finance Guru | 0.75% of market value |
| **25%** | NZF UK | 0.625% of market value |

**Formula**:
```
Zakat = Market Value × 30% × 2.5% = 0.75% effective rate
```

### When to Use Each Approach

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Diversified portfolio (ETFs, index funds) | 30% proxy |
| Individual stock with published financials | Calculate from balance sheet |
| Day trading positions | 100% market value (Mudir treatment) |

### Traditional School Position

> Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali scholars generally require 100% market valuation when specific company data is unavailable, making the 30% proxy a contemporary facilitation (taysir).

---

## 7.8 Employee Compensation Plans (RSU, ESPP, Stock Options)

### The Core Principle: Milk (Ownership)

> **Classical Rule**: Zakat is only obligatory on wealth that is **fully owned** (Milk Tām). Promises of future wealth, conditional grants, and unvested awards do not meet this criterion.

### Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

| Status | Ruling | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Unvested** | **NOT Zakatable** | You have a promise, not property. Ownership is conditional on future service |
| **Vested** | **Zakatable at market value** | Upon vesting, shares transfer to you—ownership is complete |

**Classical Parallel**: Similar to *'Ata* (gift)—not owned until actually delivered.

### Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs)

**Ruling**: Once shares are purchased and in your brokerage account, apply the Mudir/Muhtakir distinction:

| Intent | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Immediate Sale (Flipping)** | 100% market value (Mudir) |
| **Long-term Holding** | 30% proxy or company's Net Current Assets |

**Note on Discount**: The 15% purchase discount creates instant gain. If you immediately sell ESPP shares, the entire proceeds are cash and Zakatable.

### Stock Options (ISO and NQSO)

| Status | Ruling | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Unexercised Option** | **NOT Zakatable** | You own the right to buy, not the shares themselves |
| **Exercised (Shares Held)** | **Zakatable at market value minus strike price** | Upon exercise, shares become yours |
| **Cashless Exercise** | Net proceeds are cash → Zakatable |

**Classical Parallel**: An option is like *Khiyar al-Shart* (conditional right)—you have a contractual right, not a proprietary interest.

### Phantom Stock and SARs (Stock Appreciation Rights)

**Ruling**: **NOT Zakatable until paid out as cash.**

**Rationale**: These are purely contractual arrangements. You never own shares; you receive cash based on share price appreciation. Until the cash is paid, nothing is owned.

### Unvested Employer Match (401k)

**Ruling**: **NOT Zakatable until vested.**

The employer's matching contribution is a conditional promise. Only upon vesting does the ownership transfer occur.

---

## 7.9 Real Estate and Property

### The Intent Principle (Niyyah)

> **Core Rule**: The same property can be exempt or fully Zakatable based entirely on the owner's intent at acquisition and holding.

| Intent | Treatment | Rate |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Personal Residence** | Exempt (Qunya) | 0% |
| **Rental Income** | Income Only | 2.5% on net rent |
| **Trade/Flipping** | Full Market Value | 2.5% annually |
| **Land Banking/Speculation** | Full Market Value | 2.5% annually |

### Rental Property: The Scholarly Debate

#### Majority Position (Net Income Only)
The structure itself is exempt as a productive asset—analogous to agricultural land. Zakat is due only on the net rental income once it accumulates in cash, reaches Nisab, and a year passes.

**Evidence**: Some scholars suggest 5-10% of gross rent (analogous to agricultural produce at harvest), though 2.5% on accumulated net income is more common in contemporary practice.

#### Al-Qaradawi's Position (Full Value + Income)
Dr. Yusuf Al-Qaradawi argues rental properties should be treated as investment capital. Calculate 2.5% on:
- The market value of the property itself, **plus**
- Any retained rental income

**Rationale**: This preserves the redistributive purpose of Zakat and accounts for wealth accumulation through property appreciation.

### Land Banking and Speculation

**NZF UK Position**: If land was purchased with the clear intention of selling for profit or capital appreciation, Zakat is due annually at 2.5% of its approximate sale price.

**Alternative Timing**: Some scholars permit deferring payment until the land is sold. In this case, Zakat for all prior years (calculated based on the land's value each year) becomes immediately due.

**Maliki View**: If held as Muhtakir (speculator), Zakat may be due only for one year upon sale. However, the majority view of annual payment is considered safer and aligns with AAOIFI principles.

### REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)

REIT shares are treated like stock shares, not direct property:

| REIT Type | Ruling |
|-----------|--------|
| **Equity REITs** | Zakatable at 2.5% market value (ensure Shariah-compliance) |
| **Mortgage REITs** | Impermissible—avoid entirely (interest-based) |
| **Dividends** | Add to cash holdings for Zakat calculation |

## 7.10 Business Assets and Commercial Zakat

### AAOIFI Corporate Zakat Standard

> **Formula**: Zakat = (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) × 2.5%

This is the Net Current Assets method codified in AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 39, superseding FAS 9 as of 2021.

### Zakatable Business Assets

| Asset | Treatment | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Cash & Bank Balances** | Fully Zakatable | Include foreign currency at current rates |
| **Inventory (Finished Goods)** | Zakatable at Market Value | Resale price on Zakat date, NOT cost |
| **Inventory (Raw Materials)** | Zakatable at Replacement Cost | Current wholesale price |
| **Work-in-Progress** | Zakatable | Materials + labor invested to date |
| **Accounts Receivable** | Zakatable (Good Debt) | Amounts owed by solvent debtors |
| **Short-term Investments** | Zakatable | Marketable securities |

### Exempt Business Assets (Fixed Assets)

| Asset | Ruling | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Equipment & Machinery** | Exempt | Tools of production |
| **Business Vehicles** | Exempt | Not held for resale |
| **Office Buildings** | Exempt | Operational premises |
| **Intellectual Property** | Exempt | Unless actively being sold |
| **Goodwill** | Exempt | Intangible—not liquid, growing wealth |

### Service Businesses (Consultants, Freelancers, SaaS)

**Dr. Yusuf Al-Qaradawi's Position**: Service businesses lack inventory. Zakat is primarily due on net profits and accumulated cash—not on capital equipment.

> "Service income is like agricultural produce—taxed on the yield, not the land."

**Application**:
- Cash & Savings: Fully Zakatable
- Accounts Receivable: Good debt is Zakatable
- Equipment (laptops, tools): Exempt—tools of the trade
- Net Profits: Zakatable once held for one year

### Family LLCs and Holding Companies

For **pass-through entities**, the Zakat obligation falls on individual owners (family members) proportionally—not the company itself.

**Calculation**: Each owner calculates their pro-rata share of the LLC's zakatable assets (cash, inventory, receivables) after deducting their share of current liabilities.

---

## 7.11 Trusts and Beneficial Ownership

### The Ownership Principle (Milk Tām)

> **Classical Rule**: Zakat is only obligatory on wealth that is **fully owned**. Promises of future wealth, conditional grants, and assets under another's control do not meet this criterion.

### Revocable Trusts (Living Trusts)

| Ruling | Liable Party | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Zakatable** | Settlor | Settlor retains power to revoke, amend, or reclaim assets |

**Malaysia Note (IIUM Law Journal)**: The nature of living trusts where the settlor retains control may conflict with Islamic principles of Hibah (gift) and succession.

### Irrevocable Trusts

| Beneficiary Status | Ruling |
|-------------------|--------|
| **No Immediate Access** | Exempt until distribution |
| **Current Access/Distribution** | Zakatable to beneficiary upon receipt |
| **Discretionary Trust** | Exempt until trustee makes distribution |

**Principle**: The beneficiary becomes liable for Zakat only when they gain proprietorship, possession, and full ownership of the distributed assets.

### Trustees

> **Trustees are NOT liable for Zakat.** They are mere agents managing trust property—not owners. The obligation falls on the settlor (revocable) or beneficiary (irrevocable upon distribution).

### Waqf (Charitable Endowment)

| Ruling | Zakatable? |
|--------|------------|
| **Exempt** | No |

Waqf assets are not privately owned—ownership has been transferred to Allah for perpetual charitable benefit. Once designated as Waqf, the asset cannot be sold, transferred, or given away. Zakat is not levied on public or charitable endowments.

**Source**: waqf.org, ZATCA Saudi Arabia, Cambridge University Press

### Minor Beneficiaries

| Position | Ruling |
|----------|--------|
| **Majority (Hanafi, Shafi'i)** | Zakat is obligatory on minors' property; guardian pays from child's wealth |
| **Minority View** | Not obligatory until child reaches maturity (bulugh) |
| **UK Child Trust Funds (NZF UK)** | May defer until accessible, then backdate for all prior years |

### Regional Fatwas on Trusts

#### Malaysia (Selangor Fatwa Committee)
Unit trust funds are zakatable as **'Arud Tijarah** (trade goods) at 2.5% of the value of shares and income generated.

#### Indonesia (MUI - Indonesian Ulema Council)
Zakat is mandated on legal entities if their assets meet general provisions: Nisab, Hawl, and 2.5% rate. Indonesia exhibits "fatwa pluralism" with various organizations issuing guidelines.

#### Australia (fatwa.org.au)
Follows classical fiqh principles—settlor liable for revocable trusts, beneficiary for irrevocable upon distribution.

## 8. Zakat Distribution Best Practices

> Based on Classical Jurisprudence and Modern Scholarship

### 8.1 The Eight Categories of Recipients (Asnaf)

The Quran (9:60) specifies eight categories of eligible Zakat recipients:

1. **Al-Fuqara'** (The Poor) — Those whose needs exceed their means
2. **Al-Masakin** (The Needy) — Those in hardship but not absolute poverty
3. **Al-'Amilin** (Zakat Administrators) — Collectors and distributors
4. **Al-Mu'allafah Qulubuhum** (Hearts to be Reconciled) — New Muslims or potential converts
5. **Ar-Riqab** (Freeing of Bondage) — Historically for freeing slaves; today some scholars apply to human trafficking victims
6. **Al-Gharimin** (The Debtors) — Those in debt who cannot repay
7. **Fi Sabil Allah** (In the Cause of God) — See Section 5.2 for Hanbali/modern debate
8. **Ibn as-Sabil** (The Wayfarer) — Travelers in need

### 8.2 Forgiving Debt as Zakat

| Position | Ruling | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Majority** (Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki) | **No** | Zakat requires *Tamlik* (transfer of ownership); forgiving debt destroys a liability, doesn't transfer an asset |
| **Minority** (Shafi'i, Hasan al-Basri) | **Yes, in certain cases** | Relieving a debtor (Al-Gharimin) is financial support explicitly mentioned in the Quran |

**Recommendation**: If you wish to forgive a debt, calculate the amount, pay it as Zakat to a **separate** eligible recipient, then forgive the original debt as Sadaqah (voluntary charity). This satisfies the *Tamlik* requirement.

### 8.3 Practical Distribution Tips

- **Local vs. Global**: Most scholars permit sending Zakat to distant locations if greater need exists. Some Hanafi opinions prefer local distribution unless local needs are met
- **Verification**: Verify the eligibility of recipients when possible. Use reputable Zakat organizations with scholarly oversight (e.g., Islamic Relief, Zakat Foundation)
- **Timing**: Zakat can be paid early if need is urgent. Calculate annually on your Zakat anniversary (Hawl)
- **Documentation**: Keep records of Zakat payments. Some scholars recommend obtaining receipts for accountability

---

## 9. Conclusion

The analysis reveals Zakat jurisprudence is not monolithic but a vibrant conversation spanning centuries:

- **Hanafi (Al-Hidayah)**: Pragmatic, solvency-based approach from Silk Road merchants
- **Maliki (Mukhtasar Khalil)**: Sophisticated economic theory of liquidity and velocity
- **Shafi'i (Al-Majmu')**: Rigorous theological attachment protecting rights of the poor
- **Hanbali (Al-Mughni)**: Comparative synthesis balancing tradition with rational categorization

Modern scholars build on these foundations to address contemporary instruments:

- **Dr. Yusuf Al-Qaradawi**: The most comprehensive modern treatise (*Fiqh al-Zakah*), combining classical scholarship with progressive ijtihad
- **Sheikh Joe Bradford**: Precautionary, balanced synthesis adapted for Western contexts
- **AMJA**: Institutional standard balancing accessibility with practical barriers
- **Imam Tahir Anwar**: Hanafi-leaning strong ownership approach

These texts provide the **source code** for solving 21st-century economic dilemmas. The evolution from "debts to humans" in 12th-century Kufa to "12 months of mortgage payments" in 21st-century London demonstrates the dynamic resilience of Islamic jurisprudence.

ZakatFlow implements all these positions through the **Zakat Methodology Configuration Standard (ZMCS)**, ensuring each calculation is traceable to a specific scholarly ruling. See [ZMCS_SPECIFICATION.md](ZMCS_SPECIFICATION.md) for the full technical specification.
