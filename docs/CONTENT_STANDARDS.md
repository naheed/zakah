# ZakatFlow Content Standards (v2.0)

> **One Voice. One Truth.**
> Whether in a tooltip, a legal disclaimer, or a user guide, we speak with one consistent voice.

---

## 1. Our Persona: The Dignified Guide
We stand at the delicate intersection of **High-Stakes Finance** and **Sacred Worship**. Our users are performing a religious duty but navigating financial stress.

**Our Voice is:**
*   **Authoritative yet Humble:** We know the rules, but we respect the diversity of valid opinions.
*   **Transparent:** We never hide complexity; we explain it.
*   **Calm:** We reduce anxiety through clarity, not just "friendly" slang.

### The "Dignified Guide" Test
Before writing, ask: *Would a trusted private banker or a wise community scholar say this?*
*   **Yes:** "Please verify your ownership status."
*   **No:** "Oops! You owe money!" (Too casual/alarming)
*   **No:** "User shall indemnify..." (Too cold/litigious)

## 2. Core Writing Principles

### 2.1 Teacher, Not Lecturer (Educational Tone)
We explain the *concept* first, and use the *technical term* second as evidence.
*   **Bad:** "Assets must meet *Milk Tām*."
*   **Good:** "You must fully own the wealth... (Scholars refer to this as *Milk Tām*)."

### 2.2 Empathy First, Legalese Second (Legal Tone)
Our legal documents protect the company but respect the user. Avoid aggressive all-caps shouting.
*   **Bad:** "YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE."
*   **Good:** "You hold the ultimate responsibility for verifying your financial inputs."

### 2.3 Worship, Not Taxes (Spiritual Tone)
Avoid cold, transactional language. Frame calculations as a spiritual duty.
*   **Don't Say:** "Pay your bill", "Taxable Assets", "Penalty"
*   **Do Say:** "Fulfill your obligation", "Zakatable Wealth", "Purification"

### 2.4 Personal Story + Professional Credibility (Origin Stories)
When introducing the creator or sharing origin stories, balance authenticity with authority:
*   **Community Service** first (spiritual credibility)
*   **Professional Role** second (technical credibility)
*   **Intention** third (sincerity, not self-promotion)

**Example:**
*   **Good:** "Naheed serves on the Board of Trustees at WVMA... and works as a Product Lead at Google."
*   **Bad:** "A Google Product Lead who also does some masjid volunteering."

## 3. Tactical Guidelines (The "How-To")

### 3.1 Universal English (ESL Friendly)
Many users speak English as a second language. Avoid phrasal verbs, idioms, or ambiguous grammar.
*   **Rule:** Subject + Verb + Object. Be explicit.
*   **Why:** "Money owed" is ambiguous. "Loans you gave to others" is clear.

### 3.2 Concise & Scannable
*   **Rule:** Bullet points. Bold key numbers. Paragraphs < 3 sentences.
*   **Why:** Digital reading is scanning.

### 3.3 No "Hallucinations"
Every claim must be backed by reality.
*   **Never Say:** "We never see your data" (if a server log exists).
*   **Say:** "We encrypt your inputs before they reach our database."

## 4. Domain-Specific Rules

### 4.1 Integration & Security (Plaid/AI)
Acknowledge third-party tools as trusted partners, but clearly define boundaries.
*   **Principle:** Explicitly state what is shared (balance) and what is NOT (login credentials).

### 4.2 Religious Humility (Adab)
Never claim to be the *sole* truth.
*   **Phrasing:** Use "Based on the opinion of..." or "According to the Bradford view..." rather than "The correct ruling is..."
