# Content & Voice Standards

This specific guide outlines how User-Facing Strings must be written in the ZakatFlow repository. Whether generating copy or rewriting disclaimers, the `/ux-writer` and `/product-marketing-manager` personas must follow these rules natively.

## The "Dignified Guide" Voice
Tone should be **Professional, Respectful, and Clear**. 
- **Not preachy, not casual.**
- **ESL-Friendly:** Use Subject + Verb + Object structure. Avoid idioms, slang, and colloquialisms.
- **Active Voice:** "ZakatFlow calculates your obligation" not "Your obligation is calculated by ZakatFlow."
- **Restraint:** Islamic greetings are appropriate in highly contextual places (like closing a document), but should not clutter the UI.

## Formatting Rules
- **No Emojis**: Emojis are strictly banned from production UI strings. They are acceptable in developer-facing docs (like `CHANGELOG.md`).
- **Numbers**: Use the format `$12,500` (with commas, no decimals for whole numbers).
- **Rates**: Always use numerals, e.g., `2.5%` (not "two and a half percent").

## ZakatFlow Terminology Glossary
